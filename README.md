This is a fun little project that I worked on. It is a Javascript implementation of the famous game (Connect Four).
An online live version of this can be found in my website: https://www.aleisa.me/static/connect-four/

Native Javascript code has been used without jQuery or any other library.

I hope you can benefit from this / have fun with it!
